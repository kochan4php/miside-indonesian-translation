Mita?
Ah, awake already?
How did you get here?
You were right next to me just now.

No, I wasn't.
You froze before the mirror.
So I left.
Why have the rooms changed?

I rearranged the place
to make you feel more at home.
In here,
we can change the rooms
however we want.

You didn't have to.
I was getting used to the layout.
Either way, I think you'll feel more at ease with this layout.
// Mita card game
Right,
shall we play?
The game works like this:
This chip indicates a type,
such as health.
We each play a card,
and if your card has a higher
Health stat
than mine,
you win.
Pick up your cards.
It's my turn.
Whoa!
I got quite the hand!
I'll go first!









OK!
Your turn!
Uh-huh.
Your turn!

Highest health stat wins!
It's all about attack!
Just focus on defense!


You won!
You won!
You got me.
Oh you...

I win!
I'm the winner!
I won!
Hah, got ya!

That's a tie.
All equal!
Now that's a draw!
The same value...











// The card game is interrupted
What's that sound?
It's coming from the wardrobe.

Sound?
What sound?
I didn't hear anything.
What did you think you heard?

Knocking, as if someone's in there.

But...
There's no one there...

I'd like to open it and check.
I'm a bit creeped out.

But why...?
This again...







What's up with you!?
It's a wardrobe...
I've got my underwear there...!

Are you hiding something from me?

Why won't you just believe me?
What am I doing wrong?
What I want...
all I want is for you to be with me.

I'd like that to, but still...?

Why are you so stuck on that wardrobe?!

I want to know what on earth that knocking was!

Is it because
this world
only has these four rooms?
Isn't that enough for you?
Why can't you just be with me?


// Don't stay with Mita
I get it.
This again...
If you want to check the wardrobe,
then do so,
and find out what's in there!




What the...

That happens sometimes.
The room got stuck loading.
Just wait for a sec.

This is so weird.
Are we inside someone's phone?
Maybe a slow one with long loading times?

Not at all.
But not everything's perfect
in this world...
We're being loaded
along with the world's core.

The world's core?

Typical, don't you think?



Anyway, we can
play a console game
or just cards.
You choose.



// Mita play fight
Wanna fight?
You have to win
four times.
Bring it on.
Don't worry, I'll
go easy on you at first.


That's a good boy.
You better focus!

Whoa!
Right, okay.
I'mma get serious.

Wow!
Let's see if you can
beat me now!

You are
simply
incredible! That's some skill!


What's the matter?
Huh, that's dull.

Well,
that's it. You believe in fate?

Then,
get your act together or you'll be a loser forever!

What's the matter with you today?
I mopped the floor with you.
You didn't give it your all—
that's why I won!


All right, then.
How about we play some cards?
They're in the bedroom.



// Door > [ERROR]
Huh, what's going on?
Where's...

Uh-oh.
Sorry...
I downloaded something
from the net.
I wanted to spruce up
the outside a bit.
But turns out
there was something wrong with the file.
I'll fix it later.

Is that why we can't leave the house?
Yeah, that's why.
// Mita shy
Hey...
What's the matter with you?
You want something?



// Wall Clock
This here clock,
what time does it show?
The current time in the game?
Or is it synced with my phone?

Well, uhm...
I honestly don't know.
But time doesn't matter here...
Whether it's late or early,
a strong girl like me
is always full of energy—
I never get tired!
We can have eternal spring,
or a never-ending afternoon!

That's interesting...
but also a bit creepy.
Stuck in the same moment, forever...



// Photos of Mita
Nice pics.
I'm guessing these are of you?

Yep.
I like them, too.

Who took them?
Are there others in this world, too?

You could say that.
I'll introduce you eventually.
Just not yet.
For now, I just want to be with you alone.




// Portal
Where did the portal go?
Or whatever it was you called it?

I used a
little magic
and moved it
somewhere else.
We don't need it anymore.
It'd just get in the way.


// Mirror in the bedroom
Looking into a mirror without
seeing a reflection—it's creepy.

We can turn on reflections
if you really want to.
But, do we really need them?

Of course we do.
Or... will turning them on have consequences?

Yes.
We'll stutter and move slower.
Ever seen a cartoon with low frames per second?
It'll be like that for us, all the time.

Got it.
Then perhaps we better keep reflections turned off...

Hey, [player],
you sure like mirrors, don't you?
Afraid of seeing a smile on that face of yours?

Huh? Not really...
I'm just tired
after all the work.



// Blue sneakers
Are these yours?

Nope, they're yours.
Don't you remember?

I don't recall having sneakers like that.

You do now.
You can wear them
when we head outside.

What about clothes?
All I have in this world
are the clothes I'm wearing.
Any way for me to get new ones?

Of course there are.
Though, I've seen what you wear—
and honestly, your taste isn't great.
Either way, I'll help you get some.
Just not right now.
It's a promise.

Okay.


// Games on TV
What do you wanna play?
// Game milk
This is a fighting game!
Let's see who sours first!
What a game!
We've had enough milk for now, let's do something else.
// Game penguins
In this game, you're a penguin
sliding around.
Right, that's that game.

// Stay with Mita
Huh, what?
You serious? I thought you were...
I'm overjoyed!
And a little confused...
But...
Please, stay with me—
always and forever.












// A game about penguins
It's super simple:
just collect snowballs.
The one who collects more, wins!
Let's play two rounds, okay?!
// The first map
Wow, how did you get that many?
Tee-hee! I've got the most snowballs!
Better catch up!
Ha, 1:1!
// The second map
You're a natural penguin!
We should get you on real ice!
Pfft, you're so slow.
Still thinking of the last round?
Woah, a tie! Now that's rare!
// The game is over
Right, wanna play something else?
Or you're done?

// Tetris - Mita
What do you need that for?
That much of a gamer?
