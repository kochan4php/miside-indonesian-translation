The ring.

// Answer 1 (Where have you been all this time?)
I've been searching for a way to get you to the Core.
All in one piece, that is.
That was the plan all along, no?
That's why I had to avoid
Crazy Mita, wasn't it?
I also had to dig up any info I could
about the goddamn universe's backend, was it not?

Um... I guess...?
But how did you set the ring's route?
Why did I end up in a buggy version
rife with danger?
I escaped only by
jumping into endless darkness.

Sorry, I forgot to tell you in detail
what you needed to do...
But yeah, it was the plan for you
to take the leap all along...
And well, you did it!
Good job!
Right, let's proceed with the plan.

// Answer 2 (How did you get here?)
You must've been through a lot,
what with forgetting what we talked about.
I'm Mita, I can move between versions
as I see fit, remember?

Not all Mitas can do that,
I've seen some that can't.
And they're obviously suffering.

Yeah, their versions are broken,
their worlds bugged. I told you before.
Damn it...
You know who's behind all this, don't you?
Crazy Mita.

Yeah, it's her for sure...

// Answer 3 (Who was this Mita just now?)
That's Ugly Mita.
Aggressive and stupid.
You can't talk sense to her,
her entire world revolves around Crazy Mita.

Yeah, I've noticed.

Come on, we've got to get to the Core.

// Answer 4 (How does the ring work?)
And the ring,
is it the only way to the Core?

Yes.
Naturally, if we had the portal
we could just teleport
you right there.

Is there any advantage to the ring?

Of course!
It's easy to wear,
and remembers the versions
you've visited before,
so you can easily find your way back there.

// Answer 5 (Why does Mad Mita need me?)
Why won't Crazy Mita let me be?
She's pulled me into her dangerous game,
yet I'm still alive...

My guess
is that she's looking for a suitable player...
One who'll accept her for who she is.
After all, Mita is Mita!
As that'll obviously never happen,
she turns players into cartridges,
so no one can ever run away...
At least that's my guess.
Anyway, let's focus on what's important.

// Answer 6 (Is this the core?)
Is this it?
The Core?

Indeed. The Core.
I've tried to explain,
you players aren't truly part of this world...
Meaning, you don't need special permission to enter.
Or, well, that's what I believe, at least.
Anyway, I'm beyond certain
that the solution to all our problems
can be found inside!
[player], head inside.
You actually made it...

// Look on CoreMita
Careful, [player].
It's watching you.

It who?

I don't know either...

Cool...


What's that?
Hey!

I think I found it!

Amazing! That's great!

But I need to specify a version.

Right, her version is...
00.98

Bingo!
Okay, and what index?

Uhm, index?

I need the index.
Wait, don't tell me you don't know...?


Hmm, that makes sense, though...
Every Mita has an index,
so you can't just restart an entire version...
That'd cause utter mayhem!
I can't believe I didn't think of that...





// Answer 1 (What's wrong with you?)
Save for all our troubles,
I'm perfectly fine.
All's great, but a lot has changed...
I need to think.
And that's that.

// Answer 2 (Maybe there's a way to get to know him?)
I...
I think... It's crazy!
It's madness, hah!
It's like looking for a needle in a...

What are you doing?

Some obstacles erode with information,
you know, like the world having its guts ripped out!
Logs, logs, logs, data?
What if that's it?

Huh? What's the matter?

I know a place!
Wait here.

Where are you going?

// Answer 3 (What if we attack Mad Mita?)
You said that any Mita
resets to factory settings on death...
What if we...

just killed Crazy Mita?
You serious?
And how will you deal with a chainsaw-wielding madwoman?
She slices carrots with more than just knives!
And for some reason, she's frighteningly strong!
It's a wonder we're still alive...
Come on, we've got to get to the Core.


// core console entry
We need to enter a code...
But how do I know it?
Mita, do you know?

Maybe it's listed somewhere?
Can you try looking it up?

// core console - nope programm
That's probably not it.
That's not right either.
Nope, wrong.
That's not it.
I need to find the character reset option.
// core console - nope version
That's the wrong version.
Oops, my mistake.
That's not it.
Gonna need another one.
// core console - nope index
Something's wrong
with the index.
I need to change the index,
it doesn't fit.

// Answer 4 (Little people - Chibi)
You know, I ran into a bunch of
mini-people on the way...
What are they?

The Chibi ones?
Uhm, how to explain...?
It's a phenomenon here...
Every Mita has a Chibi projection,
and players can have them too...
Did you know that we Mitas can summon them?

Huh, how?

Watch this!

Just like magic...

But there's something wrong with my Chibis,
most are just born dead.
There's this one, though...
Or well,
she just keeps running in circles.
