Hiya!
Oops!
Sorry,
almost killed you there.
Uhm...
The fridge, I mean... the fridge almost killed you.
I had nothing to do with it,
I swear!
Truly!

Sure, I believe you!

But seriously,
this place is dangerous...
especially for you.

// After a while 1
You're anything but a coward, huh!
Watching you
as you pass through
these places is fun...
Run, pumpkin, run!
I'll catch up!
Attaboy!
Woah, this is fun!

// After a while 2
I saw you heading toward the cable car.
That's the longest path
between versions...
I wonder how you'll deal
with those who live there
in that fog.

// Panties
What do you think you're doing?
Please...
Don't look!
Fool!
You sillyhead...


Uhm, okay...


Break a leg!


Who's there?
I can sense you...
Listen to me,
you're a player,
aren't you?
Help me find...
find a...
Let me think...
my mind's blank...
What on earth is going on here?
// Cry 1
I wanted to forget everything once...
I broke every mirror,
ruined the photos...
but now...
all I feel is regret.
How stupid I was...
Everybody makes mistakes, sure...
But what do you do
when the consequences are catastrophic?
I wish I could just turn back time...
// Cry 2
They say time heals all wounds...
But what is time?
I don't believe in anything anymore...
But if time can heal,
or at least take me away,
away from this world...
Then, I beg you, please
speed up time.
So that it can kill me
once and for all.
// Cry 3
She's loved...
Have I loved too, once?
But my love's different;
her love is vibrant,
despicable...
burning...
relentless...
envious...
furious...
crazy...
// Cry 4
They called me emotional...
You worry too much, Mita...
You'll get through this, Mita...
You're not alone, Mita...
They said. But what's left?
Sadness,
despair...
and fear.
// Cry 5
Useless...
I can't remember...
Nothing at all...
Just the endless echoes...
I can't cope with the fact
that I'm trapped here...
I've always been here,
but why?
I can't remember...
Will it ever end?
I don't know...

// Mita get picture
This is...
a drawing...
I remember now,
thank you...
But my face...
I don't have a face...
It's all HER.
She took a piece of me...
threw it away...
She's strong...
and clever.
I have no right to stop you, player.
Look in the wardrobe...


Hey!
You're in my way!
Are you just going to stand there?
Just get out of the way!
Let me through!
Just because you're big doesn't mean you're all-powerful!

// HEY! STOP!
Why are you following me!
Piss off!




// Funicular - radio voice
Hold on now... Player?
What are you doing here?

Who's there?

Another player.
I'm Mitaphone.
I'm sitting here controlling the cable cars.
Do you realize
you're heading to your doom right now?

Perhaps,
but it's the only path I have.

Right you are.
Press the button and get behind the cannon.

The cannon?

Uh-huh.
You thought you were just gonna waltz right through?
You've gotta clear this Monster-slap mini-game,
so get ready to blast.

// Funicular go
Right, time to hit the road.
// Funicular win
Amazing!
You did it.
// Funicular stop
Hey, get out of here.
Nice and quick!
// Funicular wait 2
Why are you still here?
I told you to get out of here.
// Funicular wait 3
I don't understand...
why are you just standing there?
// Funicular tetris
What? A handheld?
Dude...
// Funicular goodbye
Bye.
