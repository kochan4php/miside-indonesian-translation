// The first meeting
Who are you?
What's the matter?
Can't you speak?


Wait...
You want to leave, don't you?

Yes...
I need to get back
to the previous version.

The previous version?
Why leave and go
someplace else?
Why not stay here
and be my
second friend?

// Skipping all dialogs
Okay...

// Standing by the window (Random)
You won't find your way out through doors.
You seem to be in a hurry...
Running in circles won't save you.
So eager to escape?
Look outside the windows...


// Quest 1 (Aren't you Mita?)
Player... you're a player, aren't you?
We can play together.
If I can find the strength,
all we need to do is play.

// Quest 2 (What happened to you?)
I'm uncertain, and I actually don't know...
I don't think anything bad has happened...
But everything good seems to be slipping away...
Though, at least I have a friend.
Why did they leave me?
Was I not enough?
I'm scared...

// Quest 3 (Become a second friend?)
Friends...
I have so few left now.
Only one remains...
I'm sad, player.
Will you be my friend?

I'd love to,
but I have to go on...

My heart aches...

// Quest 4 (Is this your house?) - MitaLittle
Home?
Player...you've changed...
Your arms are shorter, and you don't look so angry...
Player, you've grown softer, kinder.

I'm not sure...
what that means.

It's okay...
because I won't hurt anymore, will I?

// Quest 5 (How do I leave this place?)
Are you really leaving me?
Is this perhaps just my...
destiny?

I...

The doors won't help you.

// Hold player (Random)
Why leave?
Stay here...
Play with me...
Player...
