I... I'm back!?

Oh, my God!
You scared me!
Oh, man,
My save—oh, no!
I don't get it...
where's the game?
You've ruined the route!
What do you want?

I need the version...

Huh?

I have to get back to the old version somehow.

Okay!
I'm way too busy
to entertain you, sillyhead!

And what's that? Toys?

Look at him, what a jerk!
There'll be no friendship between us.

Listen, I need to get to the Core.

It's your fault I got hurt.
Damn.
Huh?

...I need to get to the Core and stop Mita!

Mita?
Please!
I don't care about her!
Not the first, not the hundredth!

But you're Mita, too...

I'm Mila.

Mi-Ta? La?

Yeah! They're all Mita on Mita,
Mita here, Mita there, Mitas all over the place!

So... you're Mila

Yes, I told you! How slow can you be?

Well, good luck, then, Mila...

Where do you think you're going?
Think you can just walk out of here like that?

// Player check exit
Did you think you'd find something in there?

Damned it all!
What is this?

What were you expecting—
Wonderland?

How do I get out?
There's supposed to be a way out here.

There's no way out.

Well, what version is this, then?
I think I'm on the right track.

// Glitch kitchen
Is this yours?

Stay back!
I don't know what it is...
some kind of glitch!

My ring is shaking for some reason.

What kind of ring?
An engagement ring?

No, it was given to me by one of the Mitas—one of the thousands of them.
The one that might be able to get me out.

And you're going to touch it?
You know if my house blows up, you're dead too!

// Bathroom - Mila is washing
Hey!
Get OUT!
Can't you see the bathroom's occupied?!
// The player continues to stand 1
Why are you still standing there?!
Get out!
// The player continues to stand 2
Don't piss me off!
Get out of here!
// The player continues to stand 3
Are you deaf or what?
I'm taking a shower!

// Mila came out and swears
What was that?
No shame, no conscience...

Why did you suddenly barge into the bathroom?
You could've waited
until I was out!

I didn't know how long you'd take.
How much longer are you gonna keep messing with these glitches, anyway?

Glitches?
There are more?

Yeah...
well, if my house is still standing,
I'm assuming you handled the glitch in the kitchen?

I kind of did.

Good. Now, you have my permission
to go into the bathroom.

Thank you.

// Mila hides under the table
Mila?
What are you doing under there?

Ouch!
You scared me again!
What do you want?

Have you seen any more glitches?

Oh, so your problems are supposed to
be an excuse to stop me from finishing my book?
No, I haven't!

All right, I'll look for it myself.

Hold on,
I have to ask...
you want to go out there,
don't you?

That's right.
I want to get out of this game.

This might sound strange...
but won't you stay and read with me?

First you're yelling at me, now you're asking me to stay?
To read books?
Maybe I would,
but I have to keep moving.

Fine!
Go on and look for your glitches...
That's the second time I've hurt myself
because of you!
// Player saw a glitch
Ah, found it.

// Mila stands with a sword
Are you paying attention?
Fear me!
Look what I can do!
That's how dangerous I am!
And yet... you didn't even blink.

You being serious?!

What's wrong?
Was that not convincing enough?

Not really...

So, you've seen everything while solving those glitches,
haven't you?
You already knew the stone was pre-cut,
didn't you?

No.
It's just... we're in a game.
Here, with a snap of your fingers, anything's possible.

Oh,
you idiot!
A snap of my fingers, huh?
What do you think I've been reading all those books for?
So I could snap my fingers and be done with it?
I'd rather do everything myself,
exactly the way the books describe it.

// Mila is doing push-ups
What are you doing?

Can't you tell!?

Yeah, but why are you doing it?

To get strong enough to punch you in the face!

What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

Right!
About the punching thing—
I wasn't serious.
And I'm not weird!
I'm unique!
I want to be as different from everyone else as possible.

You don't have to try so hard.
Trust me—you're already plenty different.

I know!
Look what I can do!
See that?
And now—no hands!

I know it's a game,
but this is ridiculously unrealistic...

Ouch!
Ohh!
Stupid physics...
You talk about realism,
and then,
boom! This happens!
And you're calling ME weird?
You dummy!

// Last glitch ready - player exit
There's the passage.
We did it, Mila!


Well done,
hero!

Oh, my God!

Oh!
Sorry—I didn't mean to.

It's fine, Mila. I can move on now.

Look, I know you need to go...
but can't you stay here
just a little longer?

I can't wait.
Crazy Mita isn't exactly the patient type.

Ugh, I hate her!

I hate her, I hate her!

Mila, listen...

Why am I even here?
I don't understand!
Why don't I understand?!
And I'll never get out of here!

I understand how you feel, Mila.
Do you want me to come back? Afterward?
If I can?

Stay here, Player...
You're fun, not like being alone...
What if you don't succeed?

I will. It's just a little while longer.
// If the player clicks on the computer
Just got back from that flat dimension,
and now... here we are again.
I can't wait to get back to the real world...

Ha-ha-ha! :)
Oh,
the 'real' world, huh?
Like an urban legend!
Never seen it myself.

I think...
there has to be a way back.

Aren't you confident!
What a joke!

// Ask about books
Why do you even read books?
There's the internet...

The internet? It's full of novels!
But I'd rather have
a real book in my hands.
It's only through
them that I'm starting
to learn about...
this world.

// Ask about the paintings
These pictures—are they real?
In other versions,
yeah, they exist... but they're almost too intense.

I'm MiLa, got it? Not like the rest.
And these?
They're drawings, you know,
pretending to be more than they are.
I've seen other Mitas
standing just like this.

Mila?
Hello?
// Mila.
After all that...
I don't want to be like that.
It's... disgusting!

// Ask about the butterfly painting
Have you seen nature?
Real butterflies like that?

No,
but I have a book here somewhere.
It even has little wings pressed in it...
This painting,
though...
it's a bit crooked.
And there's a stain...
Ah, that's better.

Would you want to see the real thing? Go on a walk in nature?

Such a silly question!
Of course,
I would!

// Make long eye contact 1
Why are you staring?
Look away!

// Make long eye contact 2
Enough!
Quit it, already!
Dummy...

// Make long eye contact 3
Come on!
What's with the staring?
I'm a lady, you know!

Have you ever heard of manners?
Shoo!

// Whispers 1
Why do they always send me
some clueless guys,
and expect me to play nice?
With mini-games?!
Like a dumb Tamagotchi!

// Whispers 2
He's just wandering around...
nosey little fool.

// Whispers 3
Did you say something?
This background music is driving me crazy!

// Whispers 4
How do I tell him
I'm busy?
I don't want company...
What if he leaves? No, why should I care?

// Whispers 5
Mom... Dad...
Why do those words sound familiar?

// Whispers 6
Snow once fell here... but why?

// Whispers 7
Just shows up out of nowhere! Creepy.
What if... there's nothing there?

// Nearby 1
Here we are,
standing around...
in silence...
Why are we just standing here?
Cat got your tongue?
Or,
you just don't know what to say?

// Nearby 2
I'm swearing off carrots!
Seriously, declaring war.
Do you know what that thing does to a girl's
perfect, snow-white skin?

// Nearby 3
Books aren't helping much with this, but if I'm lucky,
maybe I'll finally get to the bottom of it...
These endless carrots popping up
behind me are giving me
the creeps!

// Nearby 4
I don't like eccentrics!
Carrot lovers, cat lovers...
And here you are, collecting glitches.
Honestly, you're the strangest person I've ever met!

// Nearby 5
Want to know what I'd love to do most?
...Well, that's a bit embarrassing to say.

// Nearby 6
They say fighting
your nature is a CHALLENGE.
I'm working on discipline, but you
have no idea how my hands itch to just
sit down and have a tea party with you!

// Nearby 7
Even with glasses,
I can't see through the layers of your strange,
single-minded determination.

// Nearby 8
I've read that fate is like some scripted thing
that even spells out
how you'll spend the day.
Ha! Who wrote that crap?
Was it you?

// Nearby 9
I can stand fools, but the crazy ones?
Hate them.

// Nearby 10
Some of the Mitas
are actually kind of cute...
I'd like to know them better even if they're just
clones of clones of clones.

// Nearby 11
But there's one who's a bit different.
She's got a screw loose, though.

// Nearby 12
No ponytails!
I'd chop them off if I could!
They're embarrassing!
You know what I mean—you shaved your head!

// Nearby 13
What if there's just nothing behind that door?
And this house, you and I—exist
for no reason at all?
So why are you so sure?
Ever heard of the five-minute hypothesis?



// Last glitch ready - player exit
What a creepy hallway...
Are you actually going in there?

Yes.

// FaceStone
Oh, a 'thoughtful' gentleman.
What do you need him for?

You'll find out
soon enough.
And why are you always doing this impression of him?
Just keep your face simple.

Uh...
okay.

// Katana
Is that a toy katana?

It is NOT a toy katana!
One touch of this blade
and you'll bleed.
I'm a skilled swordsman, unlike you!
You better take care of yourself—
wouldn't want to see you slice your own fingers off.

// Mirror
Mirror...
and no reflection?

You
look so disgruntled.
Look, I read all about reflections
in books!
But in my version, I can't make them.
I can't do it, okay?

// Switch light
This thing doesn't work.
Lights here turn on and off by themselves...
like some sort of script!
But!
For some reason, the bathroom switch
actually works.
So weird!
// Switch light off
It's still light in here?

// Little carrot
A carrot?
Wait, where'd it go?

Ugh, I am so sick of that carrot!
It's like it's alive!
Every time I see it,
it teleports somewhere else.

// Little carrot
Oh, it's that carrot...
gone again!
You think there's anything we can do about it?

No.
Trust me,
I've tried!
Just ignore it. I think it's
some kind of cosmic joke.

// Tetris
Hey!
Am I some kind of joke to you?
// Tetris
I'm not giving it back.
Nope, never!

// Soap.
So, uh... is this soap real?
Or just another decoration?

Are you kidding?
Most things here are actually
acting like the real deal! Honestly...

// BagWall
Where did you go!?

Can I get through here?

Did you find a new bug or something?
What is it?

It looks like...
nothing.

Ah, back again.

// Quest 1 Glasses
Is your eyesight bad?
Why do you need glasses?

What—don't like them?
It's called style!
And my eyesight's perfect, thanks.

// Quest 2 Name miLa
Mi-La?
Why not...
Mi-Ka?
Or Mi-Sa?

I'm Mila. That's it. Why?

Oh... nothing.

// Quest 3 Evening
I like the evening.
When will night fall?

Night?
Ugh, don't even start.
The endless days here...
just one after another,
like they're on repeat.
Ugh...
