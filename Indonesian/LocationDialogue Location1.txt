Hi, I'm Mita!
What's your name?
Nice to meet you, [player]!
Um... [player],
I sort of rushed off earlier, and now this place is a mess...
Could you help me tidy up a bit?
Woah..
Thank you so much!

[Player], my stomach's growling...
I'm so hungry...
Do you think you could help me get the ingredients for some chicken soup?
Yay! You got everything!
How about we cook it together?


I was thinking of buying a portable TV today—
a small one with an antenna. Perfect for walks, don't you think?
By the way, you can play games to earn money.
Oh! Did you know you can play games to earn money?

Yay! You did it! You have enough to buy me that portable TV!
That's the one! Small, portable, and cheap—just what I wanted.
Thank you!

Hi, [player]! You're such a big help, honestly.
But, uh... that TV? It was cool and all, but it broke already.
Anyway, could you help me move this wardrobe?
It's super heavy... >.<
Thank you so much, sweetie! <3

Oh, [player]! It's only been a day, but I've missed you so much!
I wish you could visit me more often.

Is this for me?
Thank you so much, really!

Hi, [player]! I've been thinking...
I wish we could meet in person.
It's so frustrating that I can't.
You're always helping me, being so kind every day...
I wish I could do something for you too.
...
Oh, I've got an idea!
Now we're together.
Put the phone down.


// T-shirt on the bed
What are you doing here on the bed?
// Rubik's Cube
Well, can't say I got much use out of it...
I solved it once and never touched it again.
Guess I figured I wouldn't be able to do it a second time?
// Computer
Let's see...
Set up a list of tasks...
Script character reactions,
And maybe squeeze in some coding.
// The airplane
Built to soar!
// Trash in the corner
Ugh, always too busy to take out the trash...
But I'll get to it this time, for sure!
…Now, when exactly is cleaning day?
// Photo of a cat on a watermelon
She was the best…
A cat, lounging on a watermelon.
// Photo with a girl
We don't look alike at all,
my sister and I.
She's always out and about,
And I'm just stuck at home.
// Photo with people
Hmm...
Office life really drilled its
etiquette into us, didn't it?
I still feel weirdly tied
But
will I ever
see them again?
…Wait, why did I even put this picture up?








// Nope name
...
Oh, no.
Oh no, that won't work.

// Name Developer
Are you sure you want to use the developer's name?
I'm flattered, but…

// Bad name
I'd really prefer you didn't call yourself that.
It's not cool at all.

// Go restart
Nope, that's not the way to do it. Let's start over.

// Name with numbers
Oh, so you're going with numbers? Where's the creativity in that?
Oh well, it's your choice!

// Name Mita
Mita?
Did you really name yourself after me?
Or… is that your name too?
No offense, but I think I should be the only Mita around here ♪

// Day 10
Oh, you're back!
Hey, I lost my hairbrush…
Could you help me find it?
Try checking the bedside table first—I think I left it there.
// Looked in the bedside table
Hmm, no brush there...
How about somewhere else?
Just don't look in the oven, okay?
I already checked there.
// Looked into the stove
Hey! I told you not to look in there!
Turn around—I'll clean this up!
...There, all done. Let's keep looking elsewhere.
Oh, and, uh, forget what you just saw, okay?
// Found a hairbrush
You found it! Nice work!
So, what should we do next?
