There you are!
Why did you leave the Core?
I told you to wait for me!

I thought you'd be gone for longer...

Well, all righty...
I think I found something...
I think it's an index...
We'll have to see if it works!
Let's get out of here.
Crazy Mita...
I think she's busy with a new player.
So hopefully she's too busy to mind us...

Mita?
Wait for me.


Did you drop something?
Meet her again!

Mita...

Catch!


How come...

Who are you?

You're... you're alive!
Don't you remember?

Do I know you?

What's going on...
What am I supposed to do now?
I can't get out...

What do you mean, "get out"?

Wait...
That's the ring...
And that?

Not a clue what it is.

It's an index!
You found it!

I don't know what to say.

We must get back to the Core.
And you...
Perhaps you ought to come with me...

Uhm, what?
Sure...

Wait here.

Mm-hmm.
I'll sit right here.


Shit...
That was a close call.
So... did we do it?
Good.
I'm in the correct version.


Hiya!
You're a player, aren't you?
What's your name?

I want to leave this place...

You want to leave so soon?
How did you get here in the first place?
Oh well...
Fine, you can leave...
Just try the door.
Good luck with that!


A wall?
Hmm, that's all wrong.
Perhaps...
there's something in the basement that'll help you.
I recently discovered
a door in my wardrobe...
Turns out it leads to a basement.
But its full of junk,
junk and a ton of fancy equipment.
You have to enter some kind of code or something.
I don't really get it.
And I don't care.
It's also kind of uncomfortable, I mean, really uncomfortable.
Will you take a look?

Uhm, okay.

// Player thinks
I don't think
she remembers anything...
Did we do it?
Did we reboot her?
Then all I have to do is
get out of this damned game...


Not so quick.
I'd like to hug you.

Huh?
// Hugs
It was good seeing you.

Ahh...
it's a real shame
that you and I
got to spend so little time together.

Err...
What are you talking about?

I mean,
you could've stayed with me...
It's all my fault...
That wardrobe and the... the sounds.
I should have KILLED her sooner!

Wait a minute,
Didn't you...?
How can you remember any of that?

HA!
Did you really think it would be that easy?
You're just a fool...
Just like all the other players...
We've done just fine, look!
The REAL
you isn't
needed anymore.
Sorry, tee-hee.

I can't believe it...
Did we fail...?
No... I rebooted you, I'm sure of it...

You still don't get it...
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm such a great actress!
You should've seen your face, honey-bun!
This is so much fun!

Why are you like this?!
What's wrong with you?!

Yeah...
What's wrong with me?
Beats me...
Why don't you tell me why I'm like this?
Why I'll never be a real Mita?
My version, it never
existed in the first place!
I'm just skinning these naive fools,
hiding under their skins...
There's no way you can
reboot me!

Unbelievable...
You...
They're not the problem!
You're the one who shouldn't exist!

You too...
It hurts to hear you say that.
And yet!
It's time for you to go!
I'll see you again soon!
Everyone's ready!
It's
time to get you out of the console!
See you later!
You'll be my favorite cartridge...
A player with an interesting name.

// core console - nope programm
That's probably not it.
That's not right either.
Nope, wrong.
That's not it.
I need to find the character reset option.

// core console - nope version
That's the wrong version.
Oops, my mistake.
That's not it.
Gonna need another one.

// core console - nope index
Something's wrong
with the index.
I need to change the index,
it doesn't fit.

// Why kitchen
Are you hungry?
I'm great at chopping carrots. :)

// Why bathroom
Ah, I guess
you wanted to go in alone?

// Why bedroom back
Why are we just going in circles?
Why return here?
