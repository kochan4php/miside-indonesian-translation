// Player thinks + Make coffee
I'll need someone's help here.
I hope the Mita here doesn't bite...

What am I wasting my time on...




// Player tries to wake up MitaDreamer
Mita?
Mita, wake up!
Mita!

Mita, wakey-wakey!
I need your help.

Who are yooouuu?

Help me with the switches.

What switches?
Let me sleep...
Or get me a coffee.

The coffee maker's just over there.
Mita?
Mi-ita!



// Player gives away the coffee
Mita,
here's your coffee.



// MitaDreamer exercise
Switches,
you say?

Yes.

How come you know about them?
Though, why do I even ask...
Considering you're here,
you should know plenty already...

Just a minute,
I need to sit down.

And?

I don't know what to say...
But I need to keep going,
keep following the ring's guidance.

You have her ring?
No wonder
you found this place.

That's right.
So, can you help me?
With the switches?

Sure.
I will.
With the switches...


Mita, come on...
Let's go already.

Uh?
All right.
Let's go.


// MitaDreamer fall
Get up.
Are you that sleepy?

// MitaDreamer again sleep
Wake up.
We're there.


// Switches
Okay,
I'm ready.

I'm ready, too.

Well.
I'll start
the countdown.
And we'll pull the switches together.
Okay?

Just keep awake, OK!
Go.

// Player lose 1
Are you spacing out?
Come on,
let's go again...

// Player lose 2
One more try?
Come on,
I'm...
I'm falling asleep here...

// Player lose 3
I'm all but falling asleep...



Wonderful,
thank you, Mita.

Mm-hmm.


The doors...
so...
slow...


I'm off to bed...

// Why kitchen?
Why head to the kitchen?
If I fall asleep on the cold floor,
it's your fault.

// Why bathroom?
I don't understand...
what switches do you need my help with here?

// Put button
Nothing happened?
Then what's this button doing here?

// Cofee
Some more coffee?
Or you'll fall asleep again.

What?
Nooo...
This coffee tastes terrible...
I'm totally fine...

// Button
Mita? The button doesn't work... Can you hear me?
Hello?
