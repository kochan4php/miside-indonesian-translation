Hey, you!
Hi!
You want to get out?
Then help me find the key!
// Key Search
Shoot! No key here!
Nothing here—
zero, zip, nada!
Found it!

// The usual conversation
Huh, I thought you'd be shorter!
You're tall—
just like my sister!

Your sister? What about her?

Yes, my sister.
Don't say you've never met her!

Uh... I've met her... I think?

Are you a fool?

Erm...

Turns out you are...
Come on, just help me find the key already!

// Next work
Come.
Put the iron in the pipe!
Thank you!
Now get me that wood!
Thank you!
Some more help, please!
All done! Now...
wow, that's beautiful.
Press it, come on!
Get ready...
there, take it!
The key is yours!









// Quest 1 (Are you Mita?)
I'm ChibiMita.fbx!
Tons of lines,
simplest models, and—
best of all—gorgeous hair!

// Quest 2 (Have we seen each other yet?)
Sillyhead!
You're kinda cute, you know,
asking silly questions like that.
Though,
this is my first time meeting you!
But listen...
If you steal my marvelous look,
I'll make you regret it!

// Quest 3 (Why are you here?)
Don't you get it?
This is a checkpoint—
a test of your wits!
Now come on!
I'm here to guide the hopelessly lost!

// Quest 4 (Why are you helping me?)
What makes you so special?
Why not help you anyway?

What?

So foolish...
You just appeared out of nowhere!
You're not supposed to be here,
so, I'm helping you!

Bye-bye, silly!
