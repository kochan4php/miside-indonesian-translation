Mila! No! You're insane!

Ha-ha! WHAT'S THIS?
Is that a new expression I see?
Go on, let me see more!
Watching the same old face gets so boring!

// Mita arena "Hello"
How's it going, my restless little wanderer?
Still running around? Haven't had enough yet?

What did you do to Mila?

Oh, so you're not tired yet!
Perfect! Let's play another game!

You...

Let's kick things off with a little test!
Let's test your coordination!
Now your ability to act!
What if there's something wrong with you!?
What if you don't even deserve that SKIN
you're so proud to wear!?

// Show knifes
Take a look...
Which one catches your eye?
The right one?
Or
the left?

// Throw knifes
Oh, seriously?
Does it even matter?
I was just messing with you!
Stabbings are old news, anyway.
Whatever!
I've got much better games planned,
like...
// Show recorder
Check this out!
We need some music!
What do you think of this melody?
It gets my blood pumping!
I'll start
with the rules!
// Show rules
While the tune is playing,
you can move.
But when the music stops,
DON'T MOVE!
Or you're dead. Got it?
It's simple: get to the end
before the song runs out.
Let's start!
Still standing around, eh?
Run, sweetie, run!

// Ready recorder
Oh!
Look at you! So obedient!
A perfect little specimen.
I want you for myself!
That was way too easy, though, wasn't it?

Let me go!

Don't get too comfortable!
We've got plenty more games to play!
Here's the next one:
I'm going to close my eyes...
And when I open them,
you better be gone!
Got it?
If I see you, I'll punish you!
Good! Let's begin!

This is pointless...

// Ready hide
You made it!
You're doing great—this is getting exciting!
But now it's going to get harder.
WAY harder.
Hide, run, spin—

Gah, damn you to hell!

// Player falls
I think I got away...
