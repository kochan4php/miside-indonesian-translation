You made it!

What is this place?

Show me the ring.
Yeah...
There we go!
Time to clear some things up, don't you think?
// If the player did not approach the good Mitya and decided to play a race - Mita Kind
I was here waiting for you all along
and you play a racing game instead?!
Anyway, come over here...
// If the player talked to Mita first, and went through the game to the end - Mita Kind
Congrats, you won!
I've played it, too!
I even tried to collect every coin and get 1st place
to get the achievement!
And my, that sure was difficult!
It took me ages to get used to the controls.

// Quest 1 (Should I trust you?)
Well, at least I'm sane...
unlike some others...
Besides,
I'm the kindest person you'll find around here, sweetheart.
You don't want to just give up, do you?
She's a cold-blooded killer. We must stop her.

// Quest 2 (How did I get here?)
The ring, it led you here.
It's a great invention.
Only a player that has it
can find their way to the correct version.

// Quest 3 (What is this place?)
These passages
connect the different versions.
Yeah, it's kind of empty in here.
And yikes! I heard about this one Mita
who couldn't archive her version...
Her house
simply ceased to exist...
And she's supposedly hanging around
these passageways.
Poor thing...

// Quest 4 (How did you end up here?)
You know,
it's been a while since we last met.
And thanks to you,
I got out of that damned cage,
and escaped from that lunatic.
And FYI,
I can easily switch between different versions,
unlike you, my dear.

// Quest 5 (What did you do with the ring?)
I changed the route
to the one we need.
I set up the shortest one possible,
stuffing it with all we need...
It works like this: you open a door,
and the ring opens the boundary
between versions.

// Quest 6 (Are the passages dangerous?)
I've seen all manner of strange things
ever since I arrived
into this game...
Everything seems quiet here,
but the passages feel...
anything but safe.

You're right, and this place is getting
more unpredictable by the day.
But cheer up!
We've thought of everything,
and we'll take the shortest
and most well-trodden path!

I certainly hope all goes well.
But what lives in these passages?

Well,
glitches, bugs, anomalies.
Living ones.
Even dangerous ones that might attack you on sight...

Err...
And possibly other hostile Mitas.
More crazy, unfitting ones?

I know of at least one...
Ugly Mita.
And just so you know, it wasn't me who named her!
It's just...
she's a very early version of Mita.
The main issue with her
is that she causes the worst kind of glitches...
And I'm worried that we might run into her.
She's closest to version zero, after all...

// Quest 7 (Will you help me get out?)
I don't have an actual plan...
But either way,
you did make it here, didn't you?
Besides,
what else can you do
but rely on me, Kind Mita!
Ain't that the truth...

// Quest 8 (You were talking about some kind of plan...)
Indeed, we need to reach the Core.
My intuition tells me that's where we'll find
the solution to all our problems.

But why not go there yourself? Why do you need a player?

For some reason, we Mitas cannot
enter the Core Room.
I've only seen it from the outside.
But you players are different.
I'm sure that you
can head inside.
Want to discuss the plan?
Okay.
Great.
Right...
It's high time I introduce you
to Cool Mita!
Seeing as she's got a cool cap,
I just call her
Cappie.
I've been going over the plan with her,
the plan to stop Crazy Mita.
Let me introduce you, [player]!


Salutations!
You're my... new player?
What do I call you?
The name's...

Just a sec!
You...
...don't remember me?

Huh?
Who the hell are you?

Damned it all!
[player]...
I think SHE was here,
Crazy Mita...
Listen up!
Try to remember, for all our sakes!

Remember what?
Just think. Why do we look alike?

Uhm, this doesn't seem to be helping...
Listen, [player],
things aren't exactly
going according to plan...!
We were supposed to use the portal
to make our journey a million times easier, and faster.
But we can't get it to work without Cappie's help.
And we're missing some parts...
She may be fussy, but her mind works quickly...
Right, so what do we do?
I'll figure something out.
What did Crazy Mita do to her?

I... I think...
she killed her.
Killed her?!

And having died...
Cool Mita will simply reboot.
Get reset to factory settings
and forget everything important.
Which means...
our plan won't work.

Now that's horrible...
Better than disappearing forever, I guess...
But who can tell for sure?
And what about us players?
Will killing us reset our memories, too?

Your memories can be reset, for sure.
At least after you've been turned into a cartridge.
But not even I know
what happens to those of you who are killed.

Always cartridges... So, how can I tell
if I'm a cartridge or not?

Come here, I'll check
you over...
// MitaKind check
Phew,
you're not a cartridge yet.
You're a living, breathing player.

That's good news...

Sure, but what do we do now...
Let me think...
We've got to change our entire plan.
Hmm...
Wait a sec...
Yeah, I think I've got an idea!
Gimme the ring!

Yeah.
I need to change the route.

Got a route in mind?

Listen, darling,
you'll have to cross through other versions
to reach the Core.
Full steam ahead, you hear me?

And I have to go alone?
But I don't know the way, or even how I'll get there?

I'll help you as much as I can,
as much as the situation allows.
I'll give you directions and,
I'll do my best.
And then we'll talk...
First, play with Cappie for a bit.
I need perhaps 10 minutes...

// MitaKind ready, if player near
OK.
All done!
// MitaKind ready
[player],
Come over here.
// MitaKind ring
Take this.
That's unfortunately true, [player].
You'll have to go alone for now,
I need to get to the bottom of what's going on here.
My plan was flawless...
But we're worse off than ever.
I have to figure out what went wrong,
and where the parts are...
I'll try to find them.
Perhaps we can still get the portal together.
But time's of the essence.
Crazy Mita knows about this place,
and staying here means risking everything.
Good luck, [player]! See you soon!

Right...
I just hope I'll live long enough to meet you again...










// Chibi players
Why?
Who am I?
I want to go home!
How?
Why?

What the...?

// LimpingPerson
You're a...
a real person?

Hi!
You new here?
New?
You're from the real world, aren't you?

I am...
Uhm, are you all right?

It's just a limp, don't worry about it.
I've been here about a year,
and I'm doing great.
Right... Well, what is this place?
It's some sort of space between versions.
Do you know how to get out of here?

Can't say that I do.
Besides, I don't want to leave.
I don't need to.
Err, why not?
Enough chatting. I'm in a hurry.
My beloved Mita is waiting for me.
I have to find her...
Goodbye.
Wait...!
Get lost!


I heard everything!
I don't know what's going on,
but it's all so interesting!
I believe
you already know who I am, don't you?
I'm Mita!
But obviously not the same as that other one!
You know what I mean, don't you?
Cuz I've got this
HERE
cool CAP!
And BOOOM!
Amazing gloves!
But that's not all!
A kick-ass cute electric guitar, too!
I love it sooooooooooo much!
Want me to play a tune?

// MitaCap Guitar Yes
Hah!
Come here, my precious...
All right!
Well, could have played something more fun.
Oh, well!
// MitaCap Guitar No
Eh, fine.


Hey,
you're quite the energetic one!

I AM!
I certainly AM!
Anyhow...
Let's go
have some fun!

// GAME HUMMER

What a nice big button.
I really want to press it.
Can I?

Contain yourself, we'll get to that.
If you make it in time!
Now, have a seat!
// Player sit
Right.
So, what now?
Can I press the button?

Ha-ha!
I love this game!
But we're missing something.
It's somewhere in my inventory!
Just a sec...
Errr!
Well...
You do know...
That this is an adult game, no?

What was that?

Quite slow on the uptake, huh?
It's to lure beavers out of hiding...

Seriously?
I haven't seen any beavers around here...

Huh? Beavers?
Gah, enough already,
let's play, OK?!

Nah.

Come on!
You even know what game we're playing?


// How play hammer game
See the numbers?
That's the timer!
When the time runs out,
it'll tell you
when to press the button.
If you're too slow,
or press it out of turn,
I'll smack you on the head with a hammer!

Wait, you're gonna hit me?

Anyway,
you'll understand once we start playing!

// Kick player 1
Ouch!
Can't you hold back?
Did it hurt?
No.
Then let's continue!

// Kick player 2
Okay,
I'm getting used to this.
Watch me!
You're gonna love it!

// Kick player 3
I don't think this is for me.
Ha-ha!
I'm awesome!
I'm epic!
And I'm cute!

// Kick MitaCap 1
Oh, you!
Okay,
I'm gonna kick your ass!

// Kick MitaCap 2
Gah, lost again!
Doesn't it hurt?
Of course it doesn't! It's a stuffed toy!
You won.

// Kick MitaCap 3
This game ain't too bad, heh.
It's fun, no?
I like it too!
And now you're my nemesis!

// GameHammer End
That's it?
Yeah, that's it!
Let's go.







// GAME DANCE
Is that a dance floor?
It's so tiny...


Whoo-hoo!
Shall we dance?
For starters,
pick a track!

Let's go with this one.

Okeydokey!
Lemme go first!
I'll show you how it's done!

// MitaCap StopDance 1
Phew!
So,
think you can break my record?
Come on, it's your turn!

// MitaCap StopDance 2
Ah!
How's that?
Your turn!

// MitaCap StopDance 3
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!
Okay,
hit the dance floor!

// MitaCap = Lose 1
Ha-ha!
Who's the boss?

// MitaCap = Lose 2
Pew!
Three buttons,
and my swift hands!

// MitaCap = Lose 3
Maybe sitting on your butt
over those buttons
will get you a higher score. Ha-ha!

// MitaCap = Win 1
Awesome!
Honestly, I didn't think
you could do it!

// MitaCap = Win 2
Wow!
Those are some great moves!
Good job! Nice!

// MitaCap = Win 3
Bam!
You can feel the rhythm!
A natural dancer!

// MitaCap = Draw 1
You!
Me!
We the team!

// MitaCap = Draw 2
Fate's threads link us!
A perfect duet!

// MitaCap = Draw 3
Just
one mistake!
And you'd lost...

// MitaCap Next? 1
So,
how about another round?

// MitaCap Next? 2
Great, one last one.
How about a dance?

// MitaCap Endgame
Come on, come on!
We've done enough dancing!

// Just talk
// Photo
These are some pretty awesome photos.
You sure like a good laugh, eh?

Yeah, I am what I AM!
Showed 'em how it's done in this shithole! Boom!

Um... showed who, exactly?

Really, you're asking me that?
Who cares! I bet they're all blind!

// CutBoard
Whoa,
There's, um... so many.
What for?

What do you think?
It's about doing amazing things!
Like...
Cutting up carrots,
and like
cutting carrots,
and like...

Right, I got it.

Okay, to be fair,
the chopping board went ka-cha-cha! Whatever that means...
And that's all she wrote!

// Books
Rereading all of them, huh?
Cuz you're bored?

Ugh, I don't like books!
I like doing things!

That's one way to look at things.
But without theory...

Boom - movement, motor skills, touch, you know?
Books are just paper, I like to be in the moment!
If only you'd stay here with me,
we could do so, so much!
I'm sure we could...

// Fruits
Is the fruit even real?
They look amazing.
Do they ever go bad?

The apples, you mean?
They don't have time to go bad,
cuz I eat them all!
And then they reappear...

// Photo and cat
What a cute kitty cat.

Is she tasty?

Wait, what?
You don't eat cats.

Gah, you fool!
I know that!
I just meant
that I've never actually seen one!
A real one, that is.
Only pics on the Internet.
They're cute, aren't they?

Yeah, they're real cute.
I like cats.

// Mita Kind with ring
What's that?

It's the ring's interface,
and I'm changing the route.

Uhm, but you're just going in circles?

Yeah, you might think that.
To me, I'm transferring data.

Will it take long?

Quiet! Don't disturb me,
and it'll go way quicker.

Right,
so if I keep on interrupting you,
it'll take way longer?

Oh, Cappie,
I wish we could recover your memories...

Everything will be all right soon...

Wonderful!

We've no time to waste.
We've got to get to the Core.

Can I come with you?

Well, I dunno...

So, I can't?

Afraid not.

// PlayerChibi
I'm late... super late!
And I've had too much food...
Gah, work again?
What is tomorrow's date?
Where's the computer?
They'll kick me out if I don't finish on time!
Have I saved everything?
Doesn't anyone love me?
Where are we going?
Hey!
I'm running out of patience...
I've gotta work harder...
I can't get anything done!
Where's my phone?
Uhm...
what happened yesterday?
There's just no end to today!
Hiya?
Got a free bed?
What am I supposed to do?
I won't be able to finish on time...
I can't figure out what the problem is...
Any walls?
A 20-minute rest should be fine...
Sleeping is for losers!
Time to wash up and get to work!
I'm hungry!
This is bad, real bad.

// Player is gone 1
Erm...

Ahahaha.

Yeah...
He got it,
and just left.

How odd!
And funny :D

Oh, come on.
[player], what are you doing?

// Player is gone 2
What's up?

You're leaving again?

Fine!
Fine, I'll forgive you.

[player], come back to us!

// Don't pay attention
He didn't even so much as look at me!
Boring...

// quest Cap 1
What's your plan?

My plan?
What plan?

Oh, right.
You've lost your memories.

You're really something, guys!
I really should remember something!
Are you teasing me?
But looking at that expression of yours...
I can't tell!

// quest Cap 2
How does seeing an
exact replica of yourself feel?
You know, the one with the ring.

Yeah, I was gonna yell at her.
You know, to surprise her.
Holy moly! Look, it's a clone of me!
Though, I'm way more fun.
So I'm cooler, heh :)
Look at that frown...

I'm right here.
I can hear everything you're saying.

// quest Cap 3
Don't you grow tired of wearing that cap?
And don't those gloves get warm?
Why not take them off?

Err...
You're such a joker!
Or, should I take something else off? :)

I was being serious here.
Oh, okay.

// Carrot
Oops.
That's a ton of carrots!
What a funny bug!
Ha-ha-ha!

// DoorExit
Wait, hold on!
You better not see what's in there...
Let it be a secret :).

What's in there?

A secret is a secret,
and secrets are meant to be kept.

Uh-huh.
Why are you riling yourself up?

// Tetris
Whoa!
What's that?
A console!?
Lemme have a go!

Uh-oh.

What do you do in this one?

You just collect coins,
and avoid frogs.

Gah, sounds beyond boring.
Seriously, you call that a game?

// Tetris again
Where did you get that?
It's not like I returned it to you.
Weird, don't you think?

// TV
Ugh!
Way to go,
you found a bug!
That's supposed to start the video
but instead, it turns the TV
on and off!
Pretty cool, don't you think?

// Player sit
I think I'll just wait.

What are up to?
Wakey-wakey!
Let's go have some fun!)

// Goodbye 1
Head out through that door
to the hall.

Bye-bye!

// Goodbye 2
It's time for you to go, [player]!
Go, don't be scared!

I would never
ever leave you all alone!
So stay with me!

Cappie!
No joking, OK?

Bah!

// Goodbye 3
What are you standing around for?
We're running out of time!

Hi!
Err, I mean bye-bye!
