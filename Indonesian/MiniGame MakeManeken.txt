So, what am I doing here?
I need to get to your screen...
Now...
So!
You need to ensure this prototype is the right one.
First, scan it.
Now, check the version and bone skeleton.
Take this prototype's data and compare it to the standard version.
It's a perfect match! Now, let's check the emotions.
The specimen successfully shows emotion! Time to test behavior.
Okay, we've checked everything and it all matches! Now pull the lever up.
Yay! Now that's the skin on! Pass her the box of clothes.
That's it! See those lights on top? One of them turned green, which means we did it right!
Your turn! I'll be back when all the lights turn green. Good luck!
