Wait, hold up!
Not so loud...
Going further is dangerous.
BTW...
how did you get here?

Um...
The ring opens the right doors.
I honestly don't know how it works.

The ring?

What's up with this place?
It's super dark.

I'll tell you later.
For now, go toward the exit.
Meet me in the arcade machine.



Hurry up, don't be tardy!


// After mini-game
So, get the point of the game?

That I'm made of flesh and bone, and you're made of a skeleton model?

Whoa!
Sounds creepy when you say it like that.
But, that's the gist of it.

Right, but why do I need to understand that?

Think I was telling you that going further
was dangerous, just for the lols?
You'll run into... abandoned models...
The ones given up on, the "faulty" ones.
They're aggressive, and may even try to kill you.

So, what should I do?
I'll just go
wherever a door opens.

Wow!
Then don't turn your back on them.
And don't let them out of your sight!
They get shy when you stare at them,
so shy they freeze.
Keep that in mind!







// Quest 1 (Why are there other Mitas down there?)
They're freshly made.
They need time
to gain self-awareness.
Then I guide each one
to her own home.

// Quest 2 (Why is it so dark downstairs?)
We Mitas are 'created' in the dark,
so we need to remain there for a while.
Imagine
the pain of moving from darkness straight into the light...

// Quest 3 (What are you doing here?)
Still don't get it?
I'm helping new Mitas settle in!
Who will help them if I don't?
You?

// Quest 4 (Why do we need this conveyor?)
What's this conveyor belt for?
Is there enough room for everyone?

Wait, don't tell me you don't
understand how the world works...
And that it's endless?

Endless?
Uhm...
What do you mean?
If 1.9 is the latest version,
then there are only 19 worlds.

My gosh, you really don't
get how this world works at all.
Look, I'll use this blackboard
to explain it all.
Want to hear about it?

// Quest 5 (What is your version?)
Wait,
didn't I meet you in the latest version?
Or perhaps it's just my imagination.

Well, it's quite possible.
I'm from version 1.5.
Have you been to it?

I have.
That's where I arrived
when I was thrown into this world!

Whoa!
But how...?
But what is the house index were you in?
There is a 'me' who just can't stop whining,
a 'me' who loves horsing around,
a 'me' with bad memory and who likes bullying others...
It's a long list...
Tell me what you recall.

It was dark.
There was writing
like...
"Play with me."

Ah,
what a bummer...
That's the 'me'
who bullies and forgets things.

// Mita wants to tell you [No]
Thanks but no thanks.
I'll do fine without knowing more.

Alright, suit yourself.

// Mita wants to tell you [Yes].
Sure, go ahead.
I just hope this won't be like high school
where I always fell asleep out of boredom.

You can leave anytime,
or stay and listen
if you're interested.
A player downloads MiSide
and plays as much as they want.
There, he creates a new home
and a new Mita.
This is a 2D representation.
These are the versions,
shown as lines.
The houses are placed on these lines.
Say you download the 1.14 version,
which means a new life,
a new Mita, and a new house.

Heavens...

You can ask about the details
in this drawing,
and I'll do my best to explain.

// He asks about the only circle
Why is there a single circle?

That version was released just once,
never to be repeated.
It's the only genuinely unique version.
Plus, these versions are special
and don't have any paths to other versions.
Sleepy Mita resides in this version, 1.1.

Sleepy Mita?
Because she never gets to sleep
with everyone passing through her version?

No, that's not it.
You can pass her by and make noise,
but its impossible to wake her up.

// He asks about the shaded circle
Why is this one so dark?

Uhm, that one's here
because of Pretty Mita.
She drew it.
We were arguing over
who could reach version 1.11 the fastest.

So, who won?

ME, of course!
Look, we're here
in version 1.15,
house index 809.
We need to reach version 1.11,
house index 805.
So, her path started like this.
We tried to come up with a shorter route,
so Pretty Mita suggested this path.
And then I drew the simplest one, here.
Easy, right?
Just look here.
From here, you can get directly to the correct version.
While it may seem that this house is in the way,
that it blocks your path...
Anyway, your ring works based on the same principles.
Where are you heading?

The Core.

The Core?
Hmm...
If you want the shortest route,
you'll need to go through version 1.11 too.
You'll definitely encounter Sleepy Mita there.
I think the Mita who sent you,
took the same path.
Or maybe she hasn't realized you're on a different path.
Or perhaps she's a genius
and has come up with an even shorter route!

I think I might get it.

// He asks about the inscription
What's this about?

That's for Cool Mita.
She'll be here in a few hours.
She'll move those boxes
and place a sofa here.
My butt hurts!

Emm...
Maybe I could help?

No, that's Cool Mita's job.
She's tough.

// He asks about the drawings
Is that just a drawing,
or
does it mean something?

Yeah,
it's just a doodle.
