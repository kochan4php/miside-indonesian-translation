Mita?

How on earth did you get here?

You're Mita, aren't you?
But there's something different about you...

Observant, I see.
And you're right.
I'm not the Mita you met before.
Be careful, she's up to something
sinister.

Huh, something sinister?

There's no time to explain:
if this works out, I'll tell you everything.
Get the key. It's next to the sofa.

But...

Save your questions for later!
Give me the key.
Take this ring.
Huh?
You want to get out of here, don't you?
Uhm, yeah...
Then put it on.
It's a useful artifact,
you'll likely need it soon.

Okay...
By the way, I'm
[player].

Mmm,
[player].
I'm... Mita.








// MitaKind quest 1
See that
console? Pick it up.

Are we watching a recording?
Who's that with her?

That's happening this very moment.
It's another player.
She's using him.
She might try to
turn you into a cartridge, too.

I need to get out of here ASAP.
And you too.

Yes, we do.

So, you're saying
that she's using him.
If I pull the cartridge out, what happens?

That may very well
irreversibly damage the cartridge.
Which means that...
the player would die.

...
What if I just turn it off?

That could work...
It's worth trying. There's a red power button!
You see it?
Found it.
Press it.

// MitaKind quest 2
I need to stay.
There are questions I need to ask her
to find out more about her.
Though, it's unlikely she'll play ball...

// MitaKind quest 3
Tell you the truth, this is my version.
I was keeping a player company,
when something suddenly changed.
Then she showed up...
and turned the player into a cartridge
and locked me up.

Wait, she turned him into a cartridge?
Can she even do that?
But why?
What does she need the players for?

She's obviously crazy...
She's just playing with us, and using us for her own machinations!
Turning players into cartridges...
Some didn't even realize what was happening to them...
And some that do, don't even fight back... Gah!
Now that's a dark twist...
You have to help us!
Me? But how?
I need you!
If you help us, I'll help you!
This might be our only chance.
The ring will lead you to the right version.
I'll meet you there.

// MitaKind quest 4
I still don't quite understand
what I saw up there...
That Mita...
Was she trying to kill me?

Kill?
She has a worse fate than that in mind for you...
You need to hurry.

// Hide!
Oh, shit! Hide!
Wait, what...?
Hurry, she's coming!
Follow the ringâ€”it'll lead you to safety!


Well, well, gonna tell me where he's at?

Why would I?
You won't kill him, will you?

Ah, so you refuse to tell me.
Hah, I like a challenge.
I know he's somewhere around here.

Why are you so mean to us?
You won't even tell me what's going on!
Besides...
what do you need the players for?
They're no toys!
What's gotten into you?!

Enough! Keep your mouth shut, doll!
