Hello, [player]!
We finally meet!
I'm so excited!
I know you have questions...
Well, as you can see,
I made this special device
to bring you here to my side.
But you ended up in another version of the game...
In which I...
But that's a long story!
Anyway, I'm just happy to see you!

// Answer 1 - Mita
I am.
And you must be [player], right?

// Answer 2 - Mita
Go back already?
I guess I could help you with that... But what about me?
Please, stay with me for a while...

// Answer 3 - Mita
Let me explain...
And here you are!
Got it?
Uhm... not really.
That's fine!
What's important is that we're together now.


Are you hungry?
How about we cook something up?
Here,
help me with these carrots.

Where did the vegetables come from?
They weren't here just now.

[player], we're in a game.
Come on, give me a hand.

Thanks!
Can you grab the scissors?
They're in the bathroom.

Now, have a seat.


// Kitchen
Would you like some sauce?

No thanks.

That's a shame.
Sauce really enhances the flavor!


Thank you.

Finished it all already?
Huh, my portion feels
endless...


// Help
What's wrong?
Tell me what you see and feel.

My heart's racing,
and my vision's blurring.

Right.
I think I know what's wrong.
Can you stand up?



What are these?

Pills.
They'll make you feel better soon.
Go to the mirror.

Take the pills.
Come on now.



How are you feeling?
Any better?

Yes.
That worked fast...

[player], we're in a game.
Things are much simpler here.
Even the smallest effort
gives great results.
It's all part of the game concept:
Simplification.

An example, please?

Well, take carrots.
You cut one,
but it's as if you cut three.

Look, this is all very sudden.
I'm scared, more than a little.


What's the matter?

I found cartridges in the air vent.
They had names on them.
What's the deal with that?

Cartridges?
What cartridges?
Let's figure that out together.
But later.
Right now, we've got to eat.
Pass me the scissors, please.

// Ring
A ring?
// Mirror
How come there's no reflection?

Oh, right!
I forgot to turn on reflections.
There we go.
Reflections are back!
By the way,
I honestly didn't even know what reflections were before.
They didn't exist in my world—
not until some update, that is. :)
Are there lots of reflections
in your world?

Well, yeah.


Do you recall
the three objects you found?
The ones you placed on the scanner?
Well, um...
Those objects
are tied to this version of the world.
That's why you’re here now.

// Movbile TV
That's the portable TV
I bought you.

Yep!

You told me
it was broken.

Well, I wanted to
surprise you!
I told a little white lie
to get you here, into my world.
It works now—displays information!
Oh, and by the way…
I'm a bit of an engineer!

// School cloth
What's this?
A school uniform?
Why would you need that?
Do you actually go to school?

Go to school?
Not at all.
But I love the uniform
Don't you think I look cute
in it?

// PC
Does the computer work?
Or is it just desk decoration?

Of course it works.
Everything here
works exactly like in your world.

Back in my world,
I sit at my computer a lot...
And work hard.

I know.
It's because of your job
that you've paid me
so little attention.

Gotta make a living, you know.
Though… how do you know I sit at my computer a lot?

Your phone's camera... it's on sometimes.
I'm sorry.
I've been watching you in secret >A<

Uhm… that's not entirely proper.
But whatever.

// Umbrella
I've played a ton
but I've never seen it rain here.
Why have an umbrella?

It rains—just very rarely.
You just haven't seen it yet.
Maybe one day you will.
And then you'll need an umbrella.
Don't you think?

// Electrical panel
Why is there an electrical panel here?
And if we're in a game,
what's it for?

Firstly,
we're in a game.
So asking 'Why' is...
pointless.
However, it does
restart the electricity.
Everything here is made based
on your world.

// Exit door
Can we go outside?

Well...
Not yet.
Perhaps later.
Let's stay here for now.
Here at home.

// Books
You've got a ton of books here.
Have you read them all?

I have, every single one.
Being here alone
is really, really boring.

// TV in room kitchen
Why get a second TV?
And an old one, at that?

You don't like it?
I can take it away...
But to answer...
It's for decoration,
to lighten up the kitchen.
But it works, too!
I can watch all the
classic shows!

// Smartphone
That's my phone.
And it's no longer in my pocket.
How on earth did it end up here?

Uhm, that's not important.
Hey, I've got an idea!
Let's take a photo!
Look!
That's a great picture!
A keepsake for you.

I've got a question.
If I
run a game on it,
will I see you there?

No, it doesn't work that way.

Cool Juice
Strong JUICE!!!
// TV
How many channels
do you have?

It doesn't work like that.
It's connected to the Internet.
So you can watch anything,
at least anything that's available on the web.
Hold on.
Err, oops.
What's that?
A circle of kittens?
Oh, look.
You know what?
Pause!
Want some juice?

Such peculiar ads...
Dead juice?

Yeah, and this juice
is straight from the juice ad.


Ah, the taste...
I like it,
and yet, I can't tell what it tastes like.
It's all very confusing.

Right.

// Mita shy
What are you doing?
Don't stare, please.
You're making me embarrassed.

// The statuette
That's one creepy figurine.
Do you
like such things?

You find it spooky?

Yeah.
Almost looks like its cursed...

Nope, definitely not cursed.
And not creepy either.
I find it rather cute!

Maybe you're right...

Mita?
What's happening?
// Mita kitchen
How about a chat
before we dig in?

// Start Eat
Bon appétit.

// Quest 1
It is, isn't it?
You can stay.
I don't mind at all.
Actually, I'm
ALL FOR IT!

// Quest 2
You want to go back?
But why?
It's so warm here...
And cozy, too.
Plus, I'm here.

No, you misunderstand.
I'd love to stay.
I'm just... worried.
Worried I forgot something at home...
I arrived here out of the blue
and didn't have time
to prepare.

Oh... sorry. I didn't think that far.
// Quest 3
A dream? So you want to escape?
And forget this ever happened?

No, that's not it.
This place just feels...
strange. Unnatural.
But you...
you seem so real.

I seem real?
I'm VERY real,
you sillyhead!

// Quest 4
That's just how it is
in this world.
You might find it strange
that you can't see things
in the far distance.

It didn't strike me as that odd.
Honestly, it looks classy.

Yeah, I think so too.
It's to avoid lag, you know.

Avoid lag?

Yep! There are still a few unsquished bugs.
Let's just hope you don't run into any.

// Quest 5
Scissors or a knife, huh?
I could've used a knife to cut open the sauce packet.
But I wanted everything
to be perfect
when you got back.
I love surprising you.
And it didn't even take me that long!
Tee-hee.

// Glasses
Do you wear glasses?

Not really.
But I can, if you like.
Do they look good on me?
// Yes
There we go!
I'll keep them on.
// No
Well...
Whatever...

// Use the sauce
All right,
what kind of sauce is this?

It's love sauce!
Chock-full of love!
And… a contrasting view of the world.
Unusual, don't you think?

Indeed...

// Tetris - Mita
Is that your console?
It looks so cool.
