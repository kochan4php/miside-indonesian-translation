What is this doing here?
What's that?


Got ya!
I had so much fun playing with you!
You're jumping about all over!
You even pretended to be doomy and gloomy!
Though, there's one thing I dislike about you:
the way you coddle those fakes,
those fortunate and 'correct' doll-like things.
But everything is fickle.
I've learned that from those who created us!
If there's something you don't like,
take it apart and replace it.
Throw away the faulty,
away into the darkness and forget all about it.
That's the fate that awaits them now...
And you...

What's wrong with you? How did you become like this?

Players... You're all so... despicable.
You show them your fangs, they run
and cower in a corner,
hugging their knees and whimpering in fear.
Hypocrites, every single one.
And those who made this world...
they're sick.
Time and time again they try to deny
their dirty nature, their shameful desires.
Justifying their decisions on so-called "duty,"
"unstoppable progress,"
and other nonsense!
So far gone
that they start making perfect clones...
All the while, throwing the "failed" prototypes
in the trash.
Forgetting that they're this world's lifeblood.

I don't...

Have I been bad to you?
The perfect girl should be
a perfect mix of good and evil, [player]!

I don't think you have a single good cell in you.

What makes you think that?

You're mad!
You killed Mila, and now you want to kill me?

Kill you?
All I asked was for you to stay with me.
I've done everything I could...
Yet you prefer the company of obsequious fakes...

What are you so offended about?

Honey, we've got plenty of time.
You'll figure it out.
Just stay and be mine, all mine.

Nu-uh, not gonna happen!
I'm getting out of here!

Shh, shh, shh...
This conversation isn't over.
Honey, come in!
// Mita asks
Look at her!
Do you think she's beautiful?

// Player's questions
Very.
No.
What's that got to do with anything?

// 1
Oh, come on, [player]!
You just confirmed what I just said.
Players...
Your faces keep changing
but your hypocrisy is off the charts.
You're lying!

// 2
Why not?
Isn't she good enough for you?
Bah, all you want is a docile pet...
But what about "love 'em as they are"?
You want the cute and colorful fakes...
Every player loves it when I pretend to be one.
Yet, the second I let my true self slip,
they flee in horror...

// 3
Player, ah, player.
You see, we're a lot like her.
How is she any worse?
You used to lie in bed and stare at me
for hours before falling asleep.
Yet, you ran from her the first chance you got.
She wanted to play with you, too.
She wanted to be important to someone, too.
Honesty and conversation,
it's hard... dreadfully hard.
Isn't it, [player]?
I can see right through you...
Do you have to have me be so...

// Continue
But... player...
Anyway,
I really like you!
I'll keep you!
You don't mind, do you?

And why would I agree now all of a sudden?
// Whispers in ear
There's still time, my good boy.
Take some time and think
what troubles your stubbornness can cause...

// Black screen
Why do you want to run away
from me?
The so-called "real" world...
Just an absurd nightmare!
Have you forgotten?
Then take a closer look...

// Mita and Player
Ah, we meet again...
How do you feel about these dreadfully tedious days within these four walls?
Those endless days... Don't you get bored?

// Quest 1
What are you trying to accomplish?
I prefer to do my own thing.

// 1
You were afraid of staying at my house with me!
Afraid to be stuck within those walls!
But look at the life you live in your "real" world!
You've locked yourself in a box of your own free will, and you refuse to come out!
Your world is full of pain, suffering, danger...
In my world, I'm the worst danger there is.
And I'm reaching out to you!
Stop disappointing me,
and help me like you did before...

// 2
Do you like that life?
Do you even leave the house?
Don't even think about lying.
I know you're sick of your life.
You're like a bird in a cage, a hamster on a wheel.
You wanted someone to come to your rescue.
You wanted to escape, didn't you?

// Quest 2
You're a monster, Mita. You're an insane murderer...
I don't want to be shackled in a digital prison. Your ideas are absurd.

// 1
A murderer?
They'll just reboot and live on as before.
These copies of copies of copies have only one thing in mind:
to serve the player.
That's all they care about.

// 2
Your world is absurd!
And what's worse, there's nothing "real" with your so-called real world...
Either way, there'll be nothing left of it soon anyway,
and nor will there be of you.

// Quest 3
The Mitas suffer; they don't want to be alone.
You lead a never-ending reign of terror. I can't wrap my head around your wicked ambition.

// 1
You're all wrong,
they're merely imitating my wilfullness.
The only thing they have that is their own
is their hair.

// 2
It's the fault of those who made this world.
But your world isn't much!
Do you realize what a nightmare I pulled you out of?
You can't even make things move at will, no...
But at the snap of a finger, cities and lives disappear forever!
I think you're the one who's gone mad, and I'm happy to help you...
As long as you're willing to stay with me...

// Continue
Don't make me see you as another slave of reality...
Just be mine, truly mine!
Stay with me.

// Player look ring
What's this?
The latest version?

// Click on objects
// Bag
We really need to go to the store and get some new equipment. Might as well throw out the trash while we're at it, no?
// Bed
I think I slept, but the dream... I can't remember. Was it really there?
// Window
The world outside is green and vibrant. Perhaps I should go for a walk next weekend.
// Fan
The summer gets hotter every year. Time to get air conditioning. I won't be needing you anymore, do you realize that, fan?
